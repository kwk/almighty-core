= Abstract
This document describes what the <<link,work item links>> and <<link-types,work
item link types>> are, and how you can manipulate them via the various REST
endpoints.

We also explain the reasons we for why we chose the layout as it is planned or
already implemented. This might involve a deep-dive into the way we store work
item <<link-types,link types>> and <<link,links>> in our PostgreSQL database.

[[introduction]]
= Introduction

A work item has different fields depending on its work item type. The work item
types can be defined by an administrator.

Depending on the a project's needs and the chosen workflow, an administrator can
setup various work item types like for instance _epic_, _user-story_, _task_,
and so forth. Those work items alone don't make much sense as long as they are
not associated in a meaningful manner. For example, an _epic_ can have many
_user-stories_ as children, which in turn can have one to many _tasks_. But a
_user-story_ probably isn't going to have an _epic_ as a child. A work item of a
type _bug_ might block another bug or is a duplicate of another bug.

We call these associations between work items <<link,links>>.
