= REST interface

The REST interface for work item <<link,links>> lives under its own HTTP endpoint.

When we started the discussion on this topic we planned the REST endpoint to
live under the `api/workitems/<id>/links` endpoint. At first sight, it might make
sense to have `api/workitems/42/links` to query all <<link,links>> for the work
item with ID `42`. But on second thought, this endpoint schema doesn't allow you
to formulate a query for all blocked bugs because you always have a to have a
work item ID inside of the URL.

When we decided if <<link,links>> shall live under the REST endpoint `api/links`
or `api/workitems/links`, the latter endpoint made more sense at first because
it underlines that a <<link,link>> is meant for work items. But the downside is
that we cannot have a work item with an ID called `links` because that would be
addressed with `api/workitems/links`.

Hence, we went with these endpoints:

* `api/links`
* `api/linktypes`
* `api/linkcategories`

NOTE: We may implement a convenience endpoint eventually that looks like
`api/workitems/<id>/links` but it will not be the default way of dealing with
links for the work item with ID `<id>`.

The following sections deal with the specific endpoints for manipulating all
defined resources.

The table <<crud-matrix>> gives an overview of all the available actions and
their appropriate calls to endpoints.

The endpoints satisfy the JSON API specification [jsonapi-spec].

IMPORTANT: TODO: Include links like `/api/links/22/linktype` in order to get the link type
of link with ID 22

In general requests and response for CRUD operations are modeled after the
requests and responses you can find in the JSONAPI section on
link:http://jsonapi.org/format/#crud[CRUD].
